Hello and welcome to Illuminate!

Our mission is to help you! As the Students Against Suicide (SAS), we’re dedicated to helping the students around the country tackle. The product we designed is called Illuminate. Our main mission is to connect people with mental health tools with ease of access, providing hope to the hopeless. So regardless of background and insurance, people should be able to find reliable mental health resources in their area. 

Since starting from scratch to find a therapist can be overwhelming as a busy student, Illuminate is intended to give students a more digestible and accessible database of resources without the hassle of researching for days. With access to shelters, hotlines, therapists and more we foresee that this project will lower the stress levels of most students before it leads to suicide. We want to mainly focus on providing affordable and immediate treatment. We envision that the product’s user interface will be streamlined and clearly understandable so those who are under immense pressure are able to find help right away.
